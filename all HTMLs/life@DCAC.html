          <h3>JOB PLACEMENT CELL OF DCAC</h3>
          This year job placement cell entered its third year. Despite the overall recession at the national and the international levels and the decreasing job opportunities, we could manage to successfully place around sixty students belonging to different streams of the college in various companies such as Google, Ernst & Young, Barclays Shared Services, Genpact, IBM etc. Some of the very good companies which have been coming to our campus regularly in the past did not turn up this year because of their resource crunch. It was a great set back to us. But we hope next year will bring more job opportunities for our students. Our efforts to provide them with the best are going on.
