          <p>This  year job placement cell entered its third year.   Despite the overall recession at the national and the international  levels and the decreasing job opportunities, we could manage to successfully  place around sixty students belonging to different streams of the college in  various companies such as Google, Ernst &amp; Young, Barclays Shared Services,  Genpact, IBM etc. Some of the very good companies which have been coming to our  campus regularly in the past did not turn up this year because of their  resource crunch.  It was a great set back  to us. But we hope next year will bring more job opportunities for our  students.  Our efforts to provide them  with the best are going on. </p>
